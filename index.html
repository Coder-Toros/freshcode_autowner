        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The Henry Ford Company was Henry Ford's first attempt at a car manufacturing company and was established on November 3, 1901. This became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name.[19] The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 (equivalent to $912,000 in 2022) in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). The first president was not Ford, but local banker John S. Gray, who was chosen in order to assuage investors' fears that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later at its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade the company led the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house (vertical integration).
        Henry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company, which would go on to become one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. It has been in continuous family control for over 100 years and is one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world.[citation needed]
        The first gasoline-powered automobile had been created in 1885 by the German inventor Karl Benz (Benz Patent-Motorwagen). More efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for middle class people. To which Ford contributed by, for instance, introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at the Ford factory in Highland Park.</p>

                <p>For a cheap car everything is super.From minuses,bad light of front headlights, high beam and low beam,stiff.From pluses,high clearance,simplicity of knots,not bad body,in short for a budget car is excellent.</p>

                <p>Soft suspension. But it also handles well. For everyday trips around the city, it's great, especially if the roads are not very good. It is confident and comfortable to drive on the 130 highway. The noise is sufficient. I don't know who writes that the ground clearance is low, I have enough. I had a Volvo C60 in 2012 with the same ground clearance and a smaller base, then I scratched wherever I could, but here I haven't scratched anywhere yet, although I don't drive the best roads. Maybe the tires added height, I put a 5% higher profile - 235/55/17 instead of 50. It's a reliable machine. The box sometimes pushes. After a Volvo 250 hp and a Jeep 272 hp, acceleration is a bit weak, but you get used to it, and now it's enough. The fan makes a lot of noise when it's hot and not so much when it's not, I don't know why. They say "it's a Ford", like everything is fine. I really like the fit and the center console. Maintenance and spare parts are not expensive as some say. You won't find a better choice of price-quality-comfort for 10k. Passat and others lose.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The company traces its history back to 1913, when Karl Friedrich Rapp established a company for the production of aircraft engines. The company Bayerische Motoren Werke, created from the company, was officially incorporated in 1917[13].</p>

            <p>After World War I, the 1919 Versailles Peace Treaty banned the production of airplanes in Germany, so BMW switched to the production of agricultural machinery, household items and train brakes. In 1923, the first BMW motorcycle was produced at the Munich factory[13]. In 1924, the first intercontinental flight to Persia took place on an airplane equipped with BMW engines. In 1926, the Rohrbach Ro VII seaplane with BMW VI engines set five world records. In 1927, 87 world aviation records are set, 29 of them by BMW-powered airplanes.</p>
            
            <p>In 1928, BMW acquired an automobile factory in Eisenach (Thuringia), and the following year the company's first automobile, the Dixi, was produced at the factory. In the same year, Ernst Henne becomes the fastest motorcyclist in the world on a BMW-engined motorcycle[13].</p>

                <pre>The car is large, beautiful and dynamic, but sensitive to maintenance.If you want to enjoy the car and not hate the BMW brand after purchase, then buy only a "live" car, do not buy for the last money. During the year of ownership of the car drove it about 13000 km.Never failed , but was replaced:
                    -gearbox bearings +lubricant
                    -gasket of the oil sump housing on the radiator
                    -lubrication in the automatic transmission, bushings "eyes"
                    -Gimbal crosses, gimbal fork
                    -valve glands
                    -spark plug bushings
                    -washer pump
                    Fuel consumption
                    gasoline - 10/17 econo
                    Gas 15/20 econo
                    Before buying, I advise you to familiarize yourself with the price of spare parts: gearbox, brake discs, engine cushions, pads, and driveline. Also, the cost of maintenance is expensive - many operations on the engine are carried out with its removal from the car! due to poor access</pre>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>In 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G automatic weaving machine. The principle of jidoka, meaning that the machine stops by itself when there is a problem, later became part of the Toyota production system. The looms were assembled on a small production line. In 1929, the patent for the automatic weaving machine was sold to a British company, the amount received from the sale became seed money for the development of automobile production.

            In 1929, Kiichiro Toyoda, the son of Sakichi Toyoda, traveled to Europe and the United States to study the automobile industry and in 1930 began developing gasoline-powered automobiles. In 1933, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works established a new division specializing in automobile production; it was headed by Kiichiro Toyoda[7]. The Japanese government encouraged Toyoda Automatic Loom Works to take this initiative. In 1934, the company produced its first A-type engine, which was used in the first A1 passenger car model in May 1935 and in the G1 truck in August 1935. Production of the AA model passenger car began in 1936. Early models resembled the pre-existing Dodge Power Wagon and Chevrolet models.</p>

                <pre>I bought the car in 2016 for commercial purposes. I traveled to countries wherever possible. Oil change once a month. NEVER, NEVER did Rav fail. 200 thousand in 2 years.
                    I will probably highlight the shortcomings that I experienced.
                    1. Since I am 196 cm tall, there is not enough space for the driver.
                    2. I would like the paintwork to be more durable.
                    I will probably write the advantages as advantages, because I compared them with other cars:
                    1. The price when buying a new car.
                    2. Ground clearance, with which you can confidently drive wherever you want.
                    3. Fuel consumption. Engine 2.0, on a 7-speed variator. Average consumption of 7.2 liters.
                    4. Dynamics. Many people write that this car is not dynamic. You're just comparing it to the wrong people.
                    5. Cheap service!!!!!! I want to highlight the quality of service and service of Toyota in Rivne, the responsibility of the staff. Everything is super.
                    
                    The Japanese in this car created the love of the owners for the image of the model.</pre>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <pre>My first car. In use for two years. Configuration "active". RAV of the fifth generation was liked at once, its chopped edges and cunning Japanese squint. I do not understand in mechanisms, the girl-humanitarian, I will describe practical impressions.

                    RAV has not let me down once. Just not once. In any weather, in any situation it starts and drives. The driver's place is high, visibility is good. Controllability is excellent, it holds steep turns decently. Space in the cabin is more than enough for people and suitcases, the second row is at ease, the trunk is huge. From additional options I installed a rearview camera washer, the lens gets dirty, it is inconvenient to wipe daily manually.
                    
                    In reviews drivers are dissatisfied with the multimedia screen, say, "Toyota" is stuck in the "noughties" on the level of interface of the control panel. Yes, German and English cars have it thinner. But we appreciate "Toyota" not for beautiful letters and not for fashionable screens. Everything suits me. I connected AppleCarPlay - everything is displayed and controlled without any questions. Everything is intuitive and simple.</pre>
